# Placeables
## A mod for Minecraft 1.12.2

This mod adds in-world, placeable block forms for vanilla Minecraft items which normally are only used as crafting ingredients.

Disclaimer: Placeables should not be confused with the Placeable Items mod by Ferdz and MasterianoX, though you should totally check out that mod, too :)
